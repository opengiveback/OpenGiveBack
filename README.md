# OpenGiveBack.org
OpenGiveBack.org provides the explicit definitition to the moral obligation of paying back authors whose free, open-sourced designs you are selling (hardware or software) and earning profit for yourself. Enable people to circumvent procrastination of producing and selling someone else's open-sourced idea/code/designs when you know people need/want it. Every repository should have an opengiveback file and define the percentage they (verbally) require when someone produces and sells their open-source design, if they find the proposed default "fair" 15% of all sales profits not enough or too much.

OpenGiveBack defines ways to profit from producing OpenSource Hardware while retaining morality, by establishing an amount of profits per sold hardware unit to be transferred to the original designer who published his solution to opensource.
Where there is only 1 designer, this is sufficient, however when the work is based on previously published opensource design by another author, this convention either leaves it to the author to assess how much value for the application he has added/how much the previous work is worth, and do his own OpenGiveBack if he so feels the need to.
Authors can also set an OpenGiveBack index, a percentage defining how much of the OpenGiveBack cash should be given to him, and how much to authors he based his work on. If defined, there should be an OpenGiveBack.txt file in the project directory.
Every OpenGiveBack payment must include a note on it's type.
OpenGiveBackOnlyForYou is a payment not having the moral obligation of propagating to earlier authors, and the default form of OpenGiveBack used when otherwise not defined (to prevent too much requirement of self doubt and overthinking on the recipientduring normal application of this process, the intent is to reward the author not punish him). To avoid the definition including requirements of too much microtransactions, the relevant granularity for further propagation is set to $10, meaning you as a recipient of OpenGiveBack funds should only send to other authors when their parts accumulate over 10$.`	
OpenGiveBackPleasePropagate/PleaseRecurse informs the author to redistribute the funds to the other/previous authors the work of whose the opensource design is based upon.

By proclaiming the desired profit sharing concept in the project directory, much like already done with the opensource license, you direct what happens with your work and avoid confusion should other be created.

NO NEED for giving back money
JUST A LITTLE BIT of work
a FAIR amount of work
ENOUGH work
created a UNICORN for you

An entire category, much like opensource licenses, is created by this. 
So as to be compatible with opensource licenses, the obligation required by OpenGiveBack is purely a moral one.


All consequences of not following any of these rules are moral only.
Unless an opensource project has explicitly stated it belongs to the "NO NEED for money" category, it is hereby implied that every opensource project you make profit from producing, is eligble for OpenGiveBack.

OpenGiveBack is an attempt at a written social convention, a definition of
Please donate to OpenGiveBack.org, allow us to keep being online and keep refining the idea of fair and moral openhardware production profit sharing.

Why not give the people who already invested work in the things that interest us, somewhat of a passive income source?
OpenGiveBack is an open-ended set of guidelines to inspire and ease giving back to opensource solution designers, when their work is sold for profit by a third party.
Why? Because if someone made something useful, and you're making profit off of their work, it's only fair to give some of it back to them.
Primarily, for now, OpenGiveBack is inspired by OpenSource Hardware projects, and aims to inspire giving back and make it easy by resolving some of the unknowns and ambiguosities, by wraping it all up in a brand new social convention - OpenGiveBack.
Also, individual producers and sellers of opensource hardware with the OpenGiveBack logo could incentivize conscientiouss people to pay a little more attention to this, support original designers a bit more, and make the world a somewhat better place.

Privacy is also very important, OpenGiveBack.org has a givebacktally option, however only when both giver and designer agree is it made public. A way for the author to automatically avoid this, is to have the keyword "private" in his OpenGiveBack config file in the repository in question

Like maestro singers who were doused with flowers, so shall the most popular authors on opengiveback.org receive the title of opengiveback's maestro, thus earning free promotion for his opensource work, and through the morality of those who produce it and suggestions from opengiveback.org, 
Because if someone gave you seeds to plant and grow beautiful flowers, it's only fair to give some back to the someone in question.

"I prefer you getting hardware produced by me" option, addition to the logo
"I prefer to produce and supply hardware for my designs myself"
"Designer also makes and supplies this opensource hardware, but this is 
DESIGNER ALSO SUPPLIES PRODUCED HARDWARE
(THIS NOT PRODUCED AND SOLD BY DESIGNER)

About opensource software, to simplify it shall be established hardware and software are equally valuable, unless noted otherwise. If only a part of opensource software is used, but it is the basis and foundation to any additions, it can still be said software has value of half of device, and base necessary opensource sofware used all has at least half the value of all opensource software, unless otherwise decided.
